The character pack is compatible with RPG Maker MV version 1.6.2 or higher, and requires the base game to run. You can download it from the official website for $4.99 USD, or get it as part of the RPG Maker MV - Team Fortress 2 Bundle for $14.99 USD, which also includes the Team Fortress 2 Soundtrack and the Team Fortress 2 Tileset.

However, the character pack is not without its flaws. Some users have reported issues with the sprite animations, such as missing frames or glitches. The pack also does not include any voice clips or dialogue for the characters, so you will have to write your own or use other resources.

Overall, the RPG Maker MV - Team Fortress 2 Character Pack Download Computerl is a decent product that can appeal to fans of both games. It is easy to install and use, and it offers a lot of customization options. However, it is not perfect and it might not suit everyone's tastes or needs.
