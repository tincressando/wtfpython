The book consists of 12 chapters, each with a clear introduction, theory, examples, and problems. The author explains the design principles and procedures with the help of diagrams, tables, and charts. The book also provides relevant codes and specifications for reference. The book is written in a simple and lucid language, with a focus on practical aspects of design.
 
The book is a useful resource for anyone who wants to enhance their knowledge and skills in reinforced concrete design. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in civil engineering, as well as for practicing engineers and consultants. The book is available in print and ebook formats[^1^] [^2^].

Reinforced concrete is a versatile and durable material that can be used for various types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels, and foundations. Reinforced concrete consists of concrete and steel reinforcement that work together to resist different kinds of forces. Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension, while steel is strong in both compression and tension. By combining the two materials, reinforced concrete can achieve high strength and stiffness in both directions.
 
Reinforced concrete design is the process of determining the size, shape, and arrangement of the reinforcement and the concrete dimensions for a given reinforced concrete member. Reinforced concrete design involves checking the adequacy of the member for the applied loads and serviceability requirements, as well as satisfying the code provisions for safety and durability. Reinforced concrete design also involves optimizing the use of materials and minimizing the cost of construction.
 
Reinforced concrete design can be performed using various methods and tools, such as hand calculations, tables, charts, software programs, or experimental tests. One of the most popular and convenient tools for reinforced concrete design is SkyCiv Reinforced Concrete Design Software[^3^]. SkyCiv Reinforced Concrete Design Software is a web-based application that integrates seamlessly with SkyCiv Structural 3D Software. SkyCiv Reinforced Concrete Design Software can perform beam design and column design for a variety of building codes, such as ACI 318, AS 3600, BS 8110, CSA A23.3, EN 1992-1-1, and IS 456. SkyCiv Reinforced Concrete Design Software can also optimize the reinforcement layout and provide detailed reports and diagrams for documentation.
